#summary Introduction to the project.

= Introduction =

Social Tracer is a social tracing application to be used in opportunistic networking. Its purpose is to gather data about the social interactions of individuals. This is done through an Android application that uses a device's Bluetooth to periodically scan for other devices in range. 

This is a project done at the Politehnica University of Bucharest, and will be used for an experiment performed by the students at the university. The goal is to gather traces similar to the ones from [http://crawdad.org/data.php CRAWDAD] that can later be used as input to an opportunistic networking data dissemination algorithm.
